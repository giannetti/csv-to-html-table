# DH Sources

This repository uses Derek Eder's [CSV to HTML Table](https://github.com/derekeder/csv-to-html-table) to publish a list of datasets and archival collections with a Rutgers connection, however interpreted. This list includes datasets associated with subscription databases, digitized archival collections, and datasets created by Rutgers researchers. It is meant to be a reference tool for [Rutgers] digital humanists looking for datasets to use in their teaching and research activities.
